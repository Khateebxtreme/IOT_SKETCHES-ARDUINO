**A sketch that allows a user to access data in EEPROM using the serial monitor.**
In the serial monitor the user should be able to type one of two commands: “read” and “write.
"Read" takes one argument, an EEPROM address. "Write" takes two arguments, an EEPROM address and a value.

For example :-

if the user types “read 3” then the contents of EEPROM address 3 should be printed to the serial monitor. If the user types “write 3 10” then the value 10 should be written into address 3 of the EEPROM.

**COMPONENTS REQUIRED**

Arduino UNO Rev 3 (with USB cable)
